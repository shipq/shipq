= Cursor and Scope Design

I want to update the current `shipq.ini` db section to contain
support for setting the scope and for filter cursors. We should:

1. Add an optional `scope` to the config
2. Use it when generating queries automatically.

I also want to clarify and automate the cursor design. In things
created by `shipq` we want the *created_at* timestamp to be
the thing we use for cursor-based pagination. We should make
sure that all of the queries and code we generate for listing
use that correctly to return correct results.

We should write careful tests to make sure that all of this code
behaves as expected. All of these changes should be integrated
into our autogenerated code.
